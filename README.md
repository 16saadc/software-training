RoboJackets-Training
====================

Sample projects and starter code for the RoboJackets software training program.

Demo 1: PID
In this demo, we took a look at some of the challenges faced by roboticists programming for real-world, physical systems. We discussed closed-loop controll, specifically PID controllers, and implemented our own PD controller for the LEGO NXT.
