RoboJackets-Training
====================

Sample projects and starter code for the RoboJackets software training program.

Demo 1: PID
In this demo, we took a look at some of the challenges faced by roboticists programming for real-world, physical systems. We discussed closed-loop controll, specifically PID controllers, and implemented our own PD controller for the LEGO NXT.

Demo 2: TicTacToe
In this demo, we discussed the basics of Object-Oriented Programming and fill some holes in a TicTacToe robot's code base. 2-TicTacToe-starter contains the unfinished code, while 2-TicTacToe contains the complete implementation. 2-TTTViewer is an application that connects to the robot over USB and displays the robot's perception of the board state.



NOTE: For linux users, lejosPermissions.sh is a script that helps automate taking ownership of the NXT's address in the USB bus.
